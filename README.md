# StrangerLights
 String of lights to showcase some css animation and JS

The plan was to follow an idea from [florinpop17 app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), the Christmas Lights [see more details here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Christmas-Lights-App.md). However, I wanted to add some flair to it, and make it Stranger Things.

I originally began a week ago on [codepen](https://codepen.io/heidimichel_/pen/rNdpXrM) but got the tip that would be better to keep track of changes here. It is just a small project with plenty of room to improve.

Enjoy!
